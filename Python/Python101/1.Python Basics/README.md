# Solution approach

1. Write down the algorithm on a piece of paper or break it down as bullet points in a 
   text editor

&nbsp;
2. Start from outside in
   * Known as a Pascal solution which `'frames'` the code
   * Define variables
   * Code the boundaries first and leave the container last
   
&nbsp;
3. Try to write the core of the algorithm
   * Code the container
   * Every time you hit a rock, delegate a function that hides the internal implementation
   * Chunk the code into functions

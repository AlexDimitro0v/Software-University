# Basic Contacts Application
A console-based Python implementation of a **basic phonebook**.

## App Details
- The app stores and retrieves contacts. Each contact/record consists of a KEY and a VALUE
- KEY (=contact_id) can be an integer or a string
- VALUE (=contact_details) can be a string (or something more complex like a text-file 
  or json document)
- Optional:
  - The app follows an OOP approach of implementation:
    - An abstract class/interface that is inherited from/implemented by another class

## Basic features (=minimum requirements):
  - Storing new records (or overwriting existing records)
  - Retrieving specific record via key
  - Listing all existing records
  - Deleting records
  - UI: a simple CLI(Command Line Interface) like:
    - store \<KEY> \<VALUE> (to store contact details)
    - retrieve \<KEY> (to retrieve contact details based on some key)
    - delete \<KEY> (to delete contact details based on some key)
    - list (to list all existing records)
    - exit (to exit the application)
  - Optional:
    - Add/Think about new features
